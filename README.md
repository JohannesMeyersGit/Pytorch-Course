# Pytorch-Course
To deepen my knowledge of Pytorch, I worked through the wonderful tutorial by Daniel Bourke https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A&amp;t=275s. 

I can recommend this course as it covers the code first and explains how to create, save, train, etc. models for e.g. classification based on errors.

Here is his webpage with further information and more details on the course https://www.learnpytorch.io/.
